      <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
      <p>Many people have no idea the environmental threat that large-scale use of artificial intelligence poses. Before exploring the impact that <strong>energy consumption</strong> and <strong>water use</strong> have on the environment, it's important to understand how and why AI uses so many resources.</p>

    <section class = "basics-section">
      <h2>How AI Uses Energy and Water</h2>
      <!-- <p>AI depends on <strong>data centers</strong> — large facilities that store and process enormous amounts of information. Training large language models requires massive <strong>computing power</strong>, supported by high-performance GPUs. These systems generate significant heat, requiring constant cooling that consumes vast amounts of <strong>energy</strong> and <strong>water</strong>.</p> -->
      <div class = "basics-text">
        <p>AI requires <strong>data centers</strong> to function- large facilities that store and process large amounts of data. Training artificial intelligence models in AI data centers takes a lot of computing power and extremely powerful processors. These <strong>graphics processing units (GPUs)</strong> generate significant heat which requires cooling that consumes enormous amounts of <strong>water</strong> and <strong>energy</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Even the CEO of OpenAI has warnings</h2>
      <div class = "tweet-text">
        <p>The CEO of OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT, responded to a twitter user asking how much money has been spent on electricity for ChatGPT by saying, “Tens of millions of dollars well spent — you never know”.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "tweet-image">
        <a href = "https://twitter.com/sama/status/1912646035979239430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1912646035979239430%7Ctwgr%5E8fb623dcb6850fcbde5e9fafa5d631c4aeed1d06%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Ftech%2F2025%2F04%2F22%2Fplease-thank-you-chatgpt-openai-energy-costs%2F83207447007%2F"><img src = "src/tweet-image.png" alt = "tweet-image"></a>
      </div>
      <p>While this seems like a funny lesson to AI users to stop saying "please" and "thank you" so often, it reveals a deeper problem. If a handful of extra characters warrant a response from the CEO of ChatGPT's parent company, what do all the lengthy questions and queries students have for AI everyday add up to for the environment? </p>

    <h1>Proposed AI Data Center in Yspilanti</h1>
    <section class = "proposed-section">
      <p>The University of Michigan has proposed the building of a new data center in Ypsilanti with Los Alamos National Laboratory. According to its website, Los Alamos addresses national security challenges while also working with the Department of Energy. The Ypsilanti Township has stated that the proposed high-performance computing facility and AI data center will focus on “science, energy, and national security” (Ypsilanti Township). Neither the University of Michigan nor Los Alamos National Laboratory has explained how an AI data center, which consumes extensive amounts of energy and water, will aid in development of energy-saving practices. Its also unclear how this facility will support the environmental management that Los Alamos National Laboratory has stated that they focus on.</p>
